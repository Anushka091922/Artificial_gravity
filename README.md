# Artificial_gravity
## Initial idea of the project:
The initial idea of the project is that in case of the international space station, we dont have gravity in the space. hence, just like we have created artificial vaccum on the earth in the same way i am intending to develop the artificial gravity in the international space station or the space craft. so firstly, i am going to develop the simulation project for this as to how we can develop the artificial gravity and the rest part also includes artificial intelligence and machirn learning applications for the project. after the final completion of the project i will write one abstract on the same

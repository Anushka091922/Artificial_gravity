# Artificial_gravity
## Initial idea of the project:
The initial idea of the project is that, in the case of the international space station, we don't have gravity in space. hence, just like we have created an artificial vacuum on the earth in the same way i intend to develop artificial gravity in the international space station or spacecraft. so firstly, I am going to create the simulation project for this as to how we can create artificial gravity. The rest also includes artificial intelligence and machine learning applications. after the final completion of the project, i will write one abstract on the same
